				<p> I am currently a full-time student at UCSC. I'm a third year
				transfer student coming from Minnesota. I love reading, outdoor
			activities, and video games! I'm excited to learn more about
		what this class has to offer and what I can do. Coming from Minnesota,
	 	adjusting to the weather here was pretty well. When I first came here I was
		super hot but as I've acclimated from being here so long I've been able
		to get cold very easily. I'm excited to also see the summer course selection
		that will be available soon as well.</p>
