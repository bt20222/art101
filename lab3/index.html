			<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
			<p>The subject of this lab was to further familiarize myself
			with creating local file structures as well as further working
		with some index.html files.</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>Although it took some time to get the hang of the assignment,
				after I read through everything and got down to it, it became
				pretty easy. I had some difficulties at first importing an image
				but after I figured it out, it was pretty easy to follow the
				rest of the steps for completing this lab.</p>
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>As you can see here, I had some fun working with file structures
					and feel pretty confident about this portion of the class.</p>
